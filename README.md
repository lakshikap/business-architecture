Business Architecture Concepts and Practices

Business Architecture has been mentioned in a handful of research and organizational artifacts dating back to a decade ago. However, there is very little evolution and application out in the open. This repository contains all the self-developed business architecture concepts papers based on research and analysis of past and new information, as well as practices of implementing them in a business environment through my work. The objective is to help you learn and apply them in similar consulting practices.
